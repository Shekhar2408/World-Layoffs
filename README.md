# Analyzing Worldwide Layoffs: 2020-2023

# Project Description:

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze worldwide layoffs that occurred between 2020 and 2023, utilizing MySQL for data storage, management, and analysis. By examining the data on layoffs, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing employment changes globally during this period.

Data Sources:

Global Layoff Databases: Gather data from reputable sources such as government reports, labor departments, news articles, and industry databases.
Company Reports: Collect layoff information disclosed by companies through financial reports, press releases, and official statements.
Public Datasets: Utilize publicly available datasets containing information on workforce reductions and employment statistics.
Database Schema:
Design a MySQL database schema to efficiently store and manage the layoff data. The schema may include tables such as:

Companies: Information about the companies involved in layoffs (e.g., name, industry, location).
Layoffs: Details of layoffs (e.g., date, number of employees affected, reasons).
Geographic Data: Data related to geographic locations of layoffs (e.g., country, region).
Industry Data: Information about industries affected by layoffs.
Data Processing:

Data Collection: Gather and compile data from various sources into a structured format suitable for MySQL.
Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Loading: Populate the MySQL database with the cleaned data.
Analysis and Visualization:

Trend Analysis: Analyze the temporal trends in layoffs, including monthly or yearly variations.
Geographic Analysis: Examine the geographical distribution of layoffs to identify regions or countries most affected.
Industry Analysis: Investigate the industries experiencing the highest number of layoffs and explore underlying reasons.
Comparative Analysis: Compare layoffs across different sectors, companies, and regions to identify commonalities and disparities.
Visualization: Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps to present key findings and insights.
Tools and Technologies:

MySQL: For data storage, querying, and analysis.
SQL: To write queries for data manipulation and analysis.
Python (optional): Use Python for data preprocessing, ETL tasks, and integration with MySQL.
Visualization Libraries: Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.
Conclusion:
The project will conclude with a comprehensive analysis of worldwide layoffs from 2020 to 2023, highlighting key trends, insights, and implications for the global workforce. Recommendations may be provided for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders based on the findings.
